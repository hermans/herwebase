## 🚀 Quick Start

To run the project using PHP’s built-in server:

```bash
php -S localhost:8000 -t web


> ⚠️ **Routing Note**  
> If you're not using `php -S`, make sure to enable `.htaccess` in the `web/` directory and configure routing in `app/config/web.php` to ensure routes and assets work correctly.
